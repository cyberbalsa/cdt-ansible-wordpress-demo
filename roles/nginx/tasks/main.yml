# =============================================================================
# Nginx Web Server Setup (Reverse Proxy)
# =============================================================================
# This role installs Nginx as a reverse proxy in front of WordPress.
#
# After completing this role, you will have:
# - Nginx installed and running
# - A site configuration that proxies requests to PHP-FPM on the WordPress server
# - The default Nginx site removed to avoid conflicts
#
# KEY CONCEPT: Reverse Proxy
# Users connect to Nginx (port 80), which forwards PHP requests to the
# WordPress server via FastCGI (port 9000). Nginx handles static files
# directly, improving performance. This separation also means you can add
# SSL, caching, or load balancing later without touching WordPress.
# =============================================================================

# Install the Nginx web server. Same apt pattern as MySQL and PHP.
- name: Install Nginx
  ansible.builtin.apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present
    update_cache: true

# Deploy the Nginx site configuration from a Jinja2 template.
# The template fills in the WordPress server IP and install directory so
# Nginx knows where to forward requests. Changes trigger a restart via
# the 'notify' handler.
- name: Deploy Nginx site configuration
  ansible.builtin.template:
    src: wordpress.conf.j2
    dest: /etc/nginx/sites-available/wordpress
    mode: '0644'
  notify: Restart Nginx

# Activate the site by creating a symlink from sites-enabled/ to
# sites-available/. Nginx only reads configs from sites-enabled/.
# Using state: link makes this idempotent — if the link exists, Ansible
# reports "ok" and moves on.
- name: Enable WordPress site
  ansible.builtin.file:
    src: /etc/nginx/sites-available/wordpress
    dest: /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/wordpress
    state: link
  notify: Restart Nginx

# Remove the default site that ships with Nginx. It would conflict with
# our WordPress configuration. state: absent is idempotent — if the file
# is already gone, Ansible does nothing.
- name: Remove default Nginx site
  ansible.builtin.file:
    path: /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
    state: absent
  notify: Restart Nginx

# Ensure Nginx is running and set to start on boot.
- name: Ensure Nginx is running
  ansible.builtin.service:
    name: nginx
    state: started
    enabled: true
