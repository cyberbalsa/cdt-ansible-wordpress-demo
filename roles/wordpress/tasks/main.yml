# =============================================================================
# WordPress Application Server Setup
# =============================================================================
# This role installs WordPress with PHP on the application server.
#
# After completing this role, you will have:
# - PHP and required extensions installed
# - WordPress downloaded and configured
# - WordPress connected to the MySQL database
# - PHP-FPM listening on the network for Nginx to connect
#
# KEY CONCEPT: Templates
# The template module takes a Jinja2 file (*.j2) and fills in variables
# before copying it to the server. This is how we inject database credentials
# into wp-config.php without hardcoding them.
# =============================================================================

# Install PHP and all extensions WordPress needs. The 'php_packages' variable
# is a list defined in group_vars/all.yml — the apt module accepts a list and
# installs every package in one transaction.

  ansible.builtin.apt:

    update_cache: true

# Create the target directory before we extract files into it.
# owner/group set to www-data so the web server can read the files.
- name: Create WordPress directory
  ansible.builtin.file:
    path: "{{ wordpress_install_dir }}"
    state: directory

# Download the WordPress tarball from wordpress.org. The get_url module
# handles HTTP downloads and can verify checksums if needed.
- name: Download WordPress
  ansible.builtin.get_url:
    url: "{{ wordpress_download_url }}"
    dest: /tmp/wordpress.tar.gz
    mode: '0644'

# Extract WordPress into the install directory.
# - remote_src: true — the archive is already on the server (from get_url)
# - extra_opts: ["--strip-components=1"] — the tarball contains a wordpress/
#   subdirectory; this strips it so files land directly in wordpress_install_dir
# - creates: — if wp-settings.php already exists, skip extraction entirely.
#   This makes the task idempotent and avoids overwriting files on re-runs.

# Deploy wp-config.php from a Jinja2 template. Ansible fills in database
# credentials (db name, user, password, host) from our variables.
# Permissions are restricted (0640) because this file contains passwords.

# PHP-FPM defaults to listening on a Unix socket. We change it to listen
# on TCP port 9000 so the Nginx server (a different machine) can connect
# over the network.
